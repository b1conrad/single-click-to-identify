The idea of a person (usually named Alice) who makes connections
with Faber College, ACME Corp, and Trust Bank, is not new.
It is used by many proponents of Self-Sovereign Identity.

The idea came from session 11J of IIW XXIX 
(see [reference 29](https://b1conrad.github.io/resume/#Ref29) from author's resume).
